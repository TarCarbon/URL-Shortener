# Url Shortener
This is the final project of JavaDeveloper (14) GoIt course.
This project is a REST API service that allows users to
create and use short URLs. There is also an option to edit a short link for easier
readability. Users have the ability to view their statistics. Each short link has
limited time life.

#### Tech stack we used

- Spring Boot
- Spring Data
- PostgreSQL
- FlyWay
- OpenApi 3.0 (Swagger)
- JWT
- Mockito
- CI pipeline (GitHub actions)
- Docker
- Docker-compose


During the development process, two profiles were used. `dev` for design purposes
(a local version of the H2 database was used for simplicity and testing),
and the `prod` for production (utilizing PostgreSQL and docker-compose).


Generated OpenApi documentation avaliable (when app running) [Swagger-ui](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) and
[OAS](http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs)
